trying:
  
[ ] design new simple channel architecture
  [ ] using a delegate
[ ] server side

transition: 

[ ] clean out
[ ] move to github
[ ] do mockups
  [ ] MAIN question: what's the minimal interface which has "magic"?!?!

prototype:

[ ] then do fun stuff with this -- a real calendar  

someday:

[ ] access permissions for get/post/put/delete
  [ ] RemoteModel
  [ ] RemoteMethod




<!-- [x] test out history API
  [x] can this be used as a router? - YES .. but some weirdness to figure out

[ ] do the whole remote model thing


[ ] test out the channel API
  [ ] do I want to wrap it?
  [ ] perhaps as a remote function call?
  
[ ] start to write the game

[ ] create game mockups (keynote?)
[ ] CMU stuff
[ ] move to github
  [ ] recursive copy to a new folder
  [ ] clear out the bad files (including tmproj)
  [ ] main.coffee/html -> game.coffee/html
  [ ] submit to github
  [ ] add tmproj
[ ] start coding a mockup of the game


variable naming conventions:

*_json -> a python object which can be serialized with json.dumps -->
