ALWAYS REMEMBER: what's the minimal interface which has "magic"?!?!
  
(I've been violating that)
  
[ ] event management
  [ ] add event -> click on calendar
[ ] better requests
  [ ] add constraints
  [ ] show constraints
  [ ] connect constraints + requests
  [ ] periodic add
  [ ] score
  [ ] timer
  
[ ] three main modes - implement
  [ ] test mode
    [ ] basic requests
    [ ] link: request <-> event  
  [ ] type mode
  [ ] do mode (wizard of oz)
  [ ] do mode (real)


before launch:

[ ] access permissions for get/post/put/delete
  [ ] RemoteModel
  [ ] RemoteMethod

<!-- [x] test out history API
  [x] can this be used as a router? - YES .. but some weirdness to figure out

[ ] do the whole remote model thing


[ ] test out the channel API
  [ ] do I want to wrap it?
  [ ] perhaps as a remote function call?
  
[ ] start to write the game

[ ] create game mockups (keynote?)
[ ] CMU stuff
[ ] move to github
  [ ] recursive copy to a new folder
  [ ] clear out the bad files (including tmproj)
  [ ] main.coffee/html -> game.coffee/html
  [ ] submit to github
  [ ] add tmproj
[ ] start coding a mockup of the game


variable naming conventions:

*_json -> a python object which can be serialized with json.dumps -->
